oVirt LLDP labeler is a service which periodically checks LLDP information for configured clusters. Based on this
information the labeler tries to find VLAN tag and add label to the corresponding interface. This is standalone service
which can run on any machine with python oVirt SDK installed.


CLI
---

oVirt LLDP labeler has built in CLI tool. For one time run you can just use `python ovirt_lldp_labeler_cli.py`.
This tool is located in `/usr/share/ovirt-lldp-labeler/`.

Print help with `-h` or `--help` switch.

Service
-------

The oVirt LLDP labeler service consists of two parts. First is `ovirt-lldp-labeler.service` which runs only one time
and then dies. Second part is `ovirt-lldp-labeler.timer`, this timer service when started will run periodically
`ovirt-lldp-labeler.service`. Please note that correct function only the timer has to be in `active` state.

To enable the timer service run `systemctl enable ovirt-lldp-labeler.timer` and
`systemctl start ovirt-lldp-labeler.timer`. One time only run can be done by either CLI tool or by running
`systemctl start ovirt-lldp-labeler`.

Configuration
-------------

The configuration of the labeler are splitted in to two config files.
`/etc/ovirt-lldp-labeler/conf.d/ovirt-lldp-credentials.conf` and `/etc/ovirt-lldp-labeler/conf.d/ovirt-lldp-labeler.conf`.


The configuration files consists of the key value pairs, structured by sections.

# ovirt-lldp-credentials.conf

This file has permissions 0600 which should prevent any security problems.

## Section [credentials]

username:: oVirt engine administrator username +
_default:_ admin@internal

password:: oVirt engine administrator password +
_default:_ 123456


# ovirt-lldp-labeler.conf

## Section [labeler]

clusters:: List of clusters separated by `,` in this list you can use wildcard e.g. `Cluster*`, which will run labeler
through all clusters starting with word `Cluster`. +
_default:_ Def*

api_url:: Full api url for the oVirt engine +
_default:_ https://ovirt-engine/ovirt-engine/api

ca_file:: Path to the custom certificate file. Leave empty if you don't want to use custom certificate. +
_default:_

auto_bonding:: Boolean value. If set to true the labeler will do auto bonding. +
_default:_ true

auto_labeling:: Boolean value. If set to true the labeler will do auto labeling. +
_default:_ true

# ovirt-lldp-labeler.timer

Systemd file used to configure the periodical timer. It is usually located in `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`.

## Section [Timer]

OnUnitActiveSec:: Time delay for every update +
_default:_ 1h


Building
--------

For building the project into rpm clone the project `git clone https://gerrit.ovirt.org/ovirt-lldp-labeler`.

Please note that for update to the latest labeler you need to run `git checkout master` and `git pull` inside
the cloned directory. Then run again the steps below. In case you are missing the local `master` branch run
`git checkout -t origin/master -b master`.

And simply run `make rpm`. Please note that for build to work you need to install `rpm-build` package.

The rpm package should be located in `~/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch`.

And finally for installation/update simply run `yum install $PATH_TO_RPM`
